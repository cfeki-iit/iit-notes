		Now I've heard there was a secret chord  
That David played, and it pleased the Lord  
But you dont really care for music, do you?  
It goes like this, the fourth, the fifth  
The minor falls, the major lifts  
The baffled king composing Hallelujah

Hallelujah, Hallelujah  
Hallelujah, Hallelujah

Your faith was strong but you needed proof  
You saw her bathing on the roof  
Her beauty and the moonlight overthrew her  
She tied you to a kitchen chair  
She broke your throne, and she cut your hair  
And from your lips she drew the Hallelujah

Hallelujah, Hallelujah  
Hallelujah, Hallelujah

Well, maybe there's a God above  
As for me all I've ever learned from love  
Is how to shoot somebody who outdrew you  
But it's not a crime that you're hear tonight  
It's not some pilgrim who claims to have seen the Light  
No, it's a cold and it's a very broken Hallelujah

Hallelujah, Hallelujah  
Hallelujah, Hallelujah  
Instrumental

Hallelujah, Hallelujah  
Hallelujah, Hallelujah

Well people I've been here before  
I know this room and I've walked this floor  
You see I used to live alone before I knew ya  
And I've seen your flag on the marble arch  
But listen love, love is not some kind of victory march, no  
It's a cold and it's a broken Hallelujah

Hallelujah, Hallelujah  
Hallelujah, Hallelujah

	There was a time you let me know  
What's really going on below  
But now you never show it to me, do you?  
And I remember when I moved in you  
And the holy dove she was moving too  
And every single breath we drew was Hallelujah

Hallelujah, Hallelujah  
Hallelujah, Hallelujah

Now I've done my best, I know it wasn't much  
I couldn't feel, so I tried to touch  
I've told the truth, I didnt come here to London just to fool you  
And even though it all went wrong  
I'll stand right here before the Lord of song  
With nothing, nothing on my tongue but Hallelujah

Hallelujah, Hallelujah  
Hallelujah, Hallelujah  
Hallelujah, Hallelujah  
Hallelujah, Hallelujah

Hallelujah

# Feeling Good (Muse)
Birds flying high, you know how I feel  
Sun in the sky, you know how I feel  
Reeds drifting on by, you know how I feel  
It's a new dawn, it's a new day, it's a new life for me  
And I'm feeling good

Fish in the sea, you know how I feel  
River running free, you know how I feel  
Blossom in the trees, you know how I feel  
It's a new dawn, it's a new day, it's a new life for me  
And I'm feeling good

Dragonflies all out in the sun  
You know what I mean, don't you know  
Butterflies are all having fun  
You know what I mean  
Sleep in peace  
When the day is done  
And this old world is a new world and a bold world for me

Stars when you shine, you know how I feel  
Scent of the pine, you know how I feel  
Yeah freedom is my life  
And you know how I feel  
It's a new dawn, it's a new day, it's a new life for me  
And I'm feeling good

Ooooh  
(Feeling good)

# Feeling Good ( Nina Simone )
Birds flying high  
You know how I feel  
Sun in the sky  
You know how I feel  
Breeze driftin' on by  
You know how I feel

It's a new dawn  
It's a new day  
It's a new life  
For me  
And I'm feeling good  
I'm feeling good

Fish in the sea  
You know how I feel  
River running free  
You know how I feel  
Blossom on a tree  
You know how I feel

It's a new dawn  
It's a new day  
It's a new life  
For me  
And I'm feeling good

Dragonfly out in the sun, you know what I mean, don't you know  
Butterflies all havin' fun, you know what I mean  
Sleep in peace when day is done, that's what I mean  
And this old world is a new world  
And a bold world  
For me  
For me

Stars when you shine  
You know how I feel  
Scent of the pine  
You know how I feel  
Oh, freedom is mine  
And I know how I feel

It's a new dawn  
It's a new day  
It's a new life

It's a new dawn  
It's a new day  
It's a new life  
It's a new dawn  
It's a new day  
It's a new life  
It's a new life  
For me

And I'm feeling good  
I'm feeling good  
I feel so good  
I feel so good
