* Cloud computing is the on-demand delivery of compute power, databasen storage, applications and other it ressources via the internet with pay as you go pricing 
	* The resources run on server computers that are located in large data centers 
	* AWS is a cloud service provider 
	* Cloud computing renders infrastructure as software : 
		* flexible 
		* can change more quickly , easily and cost-effectively 
		* eliminate the undifferntiated heavy lifting tasss
		* you pay for what you use, when you use it 
	* Cloud computing renders ressources as temporary and disposable 
* Cloud Service Models 
	![[Pasted image 20211012223141.png]] 
	* Infrastructure as a service (IaaS)
		* access to networking features 
		* computers ( virtual or physical )
		* Storage space
		* Most similar to existing implementations within the company 
	* Platform as a Service ( PaaS)
		* Automation removes the need to manage hardware and OS 
	* Software as a Service (SaaS)
		* complete product run and managed by the service provider 
		* e-mail, drive, facebook ... 
* Cloud Computing Deployment Models
	* Cloud 
		* all part of the application are running in the cloud 
		* applications are either specifically developed in the cloud or transfered to take profit from the bigger infrastructure 
	* Hybrid 
		* connect an existing infrastructure to cloud based services 
		* most common is to connect on-premise and cloud 
	* On-Premises ( private cloud)
		* use virtualizations and resource management tools 
* AWS vs Traditional IT 

## Advantages of Cloud Computing 
* Trade capital expenses for variable expences 
	* Capex : 
		* Funds used to acquire upgrade maintain physical assets such as property and physical buildins
	* Variable expenses :
		* pay for what you use when you use it 
		* maintenance is reduced 
* Massive economies of scale 
* You don't guess your capacity ( underwork or over work your server and their running / maintenance costs)
* increase speed and agility 
* less money spent on data centers (running / maiintenance ) 
*
